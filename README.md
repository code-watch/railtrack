# Track your train journeys in Europe

Railtrack allows you to keep track of your journeys with public transport in and around Switzerland. Journey data comes from the [Swiss public transport API](https://transport.opendata.ch). Railtrack will give you an overview and statistics about your past journeys.

# Development

## Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## Local setup

```

Push the schema to the database

```bash
npx prisma db push
```
